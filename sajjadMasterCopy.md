##META-TERRAN <small>/ˌmɛtə ˈterən/</small>

Inhabitant of Earth, of a higher or second-order kind. In 2399 PC <a href="#">(Post Contact)</a> advancements in technology and war paved way for the MT Series Advancement Units.

...

In the not so distant future, humans have developed advanced forms of technology. Allowing us to harness rare minerals, explore other star systems, manipulate genealogy, & colonize habitable satellites.

We encountered an insectoid alien race, we informally refer to them as "bugs". Exopterygotan by nature, they operate under a hive mind, with individual queens commanding legions of drones.

Their First Invasion resulted in the loss of mankind's forward operating base in the solar system and massive casualties on Earth. This compelled humanity to retreat to Earth and form a new unified planetary government, GAIA. The <strong>Meta-Terran Program</strong> was enacted, with it Advancement, Infantry and Research MT Units.

##What I Do
###AUTOMATION ENGINEER
> It is in the turmoil of chaos that we discover what, if anything, we are. - Peter Wiggin

I defend software, business requirements and story expectations by implementing test frameworks & methodology. I improve the quality of code through Automation. I guide products through the SDLC.

###PROGRAMMER
> In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. - Ender Wiggin

To understand how my enemy works, I learned how to code. I work with Ruby, php & JavaScript. I follow the latest standards in W3C HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development and believe in clean and minimal code.

###GRAPHIC DESIGNER
> Humanity does not ask us to be happy. It merely asks us to be brilliant on its behalf.- Mazer Rackham

Roughly 50% of the population prefer infographics over plain text.* It's our responsibility to serve those needs. In learning Photoshop & Illustrator, I took my communication to a whole new level.

###CONSULTANT
> One mind can think only of its own questions; it rarely surprises itself. - Bean

There is no guarantee that we are all privy to information critical to the mission. Consulting and encouraging others to use proven methodology and technology is everyones' duty.

###DRUMMER
> Perhaps it's impossible to wear an identity without becoming what you pretend to be. - Valentine Wiggin

Percussion is my muse. In 10 short years, I learned how to speak fluently using Tama, Paiste, Remo & ProMark. Working with the band to make unique sounds aided in building habits to understand learning and leadership practices.
